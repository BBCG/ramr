Description: ramr is an R package for detection of low-frequency aberrant methylation events in large datasets
    obtained by methylation profiling using array or high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. In addition, package
    provides functions to visualize found aberrantly methylated regions (AMRs), and to generate sets of all
    possible regions to be used as reference sets for enrichment analysis.
