Description: ramr is an R package for detection of low-frequency aberrant methylation events in large datasets
    obtained by methylation profiling using array or high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. In addition, package provides
    functions to visualize found aberrantly methylated regions, and to generate sets of all possible regions to be used
    as reference sets for enrichment analysis.
